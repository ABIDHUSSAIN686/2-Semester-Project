# 2-Semester-Project
This project is related to the Candy Crush game by using the Object Oriented Programming 

In the skeleton code you are given game.cpp, util.cpp, util.h, install-libraries.sh and Cimg.h files
In game.cpp
You have been given “MouseClicked” function in which you can code for right click or left
click.
Also a function named as “MouseMoved” which is called when the mouse cursor is moved and
the coordinates of mouse will be stored in x and y variables.
But you need to drag the gems so another function named “MousePressedAndMoved” is given,
which you can use and build your logic according to the functionality.

For game execution:
First you have to install libraries by opening terminal in project folder and run a commad “ bash
install-libraries.sh”
then run “make” on terminal and it will create object files and game as out file.
To run the game write “./game” in terminal.
